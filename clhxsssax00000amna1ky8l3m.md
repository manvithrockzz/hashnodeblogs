This is my very first blog on C++ and I want to share some facts that you all need to know if you do code in C++. Also please note, no interviwer will be going to ask you these, but as an efficient software engineer, it's good to learn everything in a more generalized way.

* C++ is a versatile and powerful programming language that has been widely used, It was developed as an extension of the C programming language.
    
* C++ has influenced many programming languages such as C#, Java, and others.
    
* C++ supports various programming styles, making it flexible and successful.
    
* A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.
    
* If no data type is specified for a variable, the compiler automatically assumes it as an int data type.
    
* Comma (,) is both used as an operator and a separator.
    
* C++ introduces object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. However, it is not purely object-oriented, as it allows writing code without using classes.
    
* Function overloading does not work with inheritance.
    
* In addition to object-oriented programming, C++ supports multiple paradigms.
    
* C++ has four memory types: dynamic, static, automatic, and thread storage.
    

If you are a newbieðŸ¤© to the programming language you are in the right place, C++ is the most preferred language in the tech hub, also try to explore above-mentioned facts in more detail and have examples of each on your own.
