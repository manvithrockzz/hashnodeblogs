Interested in learning about JSX in React? If so, this article is perfect for you.

I will provide an in-depth explanation of JSX and guide you on how to use it efficiently in React, helping you save time and work like a pro.

Throughout this discussion🫥, we will delve into what `JSX stands for, its functionality, its benefits, and much more.`

**Let’s dive??**

## **Introduction to React JSX?**

In modern web dev🔥, there are often situations where we need to combine JavaScript with HTML.

To tackle this, React introduces a file type called JSX,😙Rather than creating a separate technology to handle both aspects together, JSX serves as the solution.

**For example**

```javascript
const x =<h1>Hey, I am Manvith</h1>,
```

here you can see👀 --&gt; this is `not complete html and not even JavaScript`.

# **What is JSX?🤔**

JSX stands for `JavaScript XML`, and allows us to write our very own HTML in React. This simplifies the process of writing and integrating HTML in React applications.

JSX provides an intuitive and concise way🧟 to define the structure of React components and their corresponding UI elements.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello World! </h1>
```

Wait, What??? Everything looks weird🫠

let me clear to you everything🐥 in detail.

We can see that **both HTML and JS code has been written in a single line**. But it is neither HTML nor JS code. It’s the HTML code inside the JS code so it’s called `JSX`.

It is not mandatory to write everything in `JSX` but it is preferred.

# **Rules of Writing JSX 😋**

To write effective `React code with JSX`, there are some rules that we must adhere to:

**They are :**

* Every HTML tag must have its `closing tag`.
    
* We need to wrap the JS code with `{}` inside the JSX.
    
* We cannot have `multiple` tags inside the JSX, but if we have multiple chunks of HTML code then we need to wrap it with `<> </>`or `<div></div>` .
    
* We need to use `camelCase` for naming **HTML attributes or CSS properties**.
    
* JSX doesn’t allow us to use `if-else statements`. Instead, we need to use the `ternary operator`
    

# **Advantages of JSX🔥**

1. It makes it easier to write HTML code inside JS code.
    
2. It can easily convert `HTML tags` into`react elements`
    
3. It helps React to efficiently update the user interface, improving performance.
    
4. Developers can include dynamic values in the UI easily.
    
5. Enables reusability with custom React components.
    

# **Disadvantages of JSX😣**

1. For developers new to React, the syntax might be overwhelming and require some learning.
    
2. Integration with certain text editors or syntax highlighters can be challenging.
    
3. Traditional if-else statements are not directly supported, requiring the use of ternary operators for conditional rendering.
    
4. Mixing HTML-like code with JavaScript logic can lead to challenges in maintaining a clear separation of concerns between UI and application logic.
    

# **Summary🤭**

* JSX stands for `JavaScript XML`.
    
* JSX is a syntax version of JS that lets you combine JavaScript with HTML-like tags to create UI elements and their behaviour.
    
* Using JSX is a convenient shortcut for invoking React.createElement() to generate elements and components.
    
* JSX looks like HTML and offers a friendly syntax for `creating DOM elements`.
    
* JSX accepts any valid JavaScript expression inside `curly braces{}`

## **Conclusion🥱**

JSX is a crucial aspect of React development❤️‍🔥, providing a concise and expressive way to define the user interface. Its combination of JavaScript and HTML-like syntax makes it a powerful tool for creating modern💻 web applications. Although it may have a slight learning curve, mastering JSX will make your React development experience smoother and more enjoyable.
