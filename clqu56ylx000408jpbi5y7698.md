You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

* `"Push"`: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
    
* `"Pop"`: removes the integer on the top of the stack.
    

You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following rules:

* If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
    
* If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
    
* If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.
    

Return *the stack operations needed to build* `target` following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> buildArray(int[] target, int n) {
        // Calculate the expected number of elements in the stack
        int nums = target.length + ((target[target.length - 1] - target.length) * 2);

        // Initialize a list to store the stack operations
        List<String> s = new ArrayList<String>(nums);

        // Initialize a variable to keep track of the current value to be pushed onto the stack
        int input = 1;

        // Iterate through the target array
        for (int i : target) {
            // If the current target value is not equal to the current input value
            if (input != i) {
                // Add "Push" and "Pop" operations until they become equal
                while (input != i) {
                    s.add("Push");
                    s.add("Pop");
                    input++;
                }
                // Add a "Push" operation
                s.add("Push");
                input++;
            } else {
                // If the current target value is equal to the current input value, add a "Push" operation
                s.add("Push");
                input++;
            }
        }
        // Return the list of stack operations
        return s;
    }
}
```
