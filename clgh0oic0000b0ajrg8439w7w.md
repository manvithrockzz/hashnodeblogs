üòé Hey!

* Have you ever thought about who runs the internet?
    
* Who controls the internet worldwide? - Maybe you could think that the internet providers companies like Jio, Airtel and BSNL control the Internet, but that isn't true because If one company stops providing it, there are other companies present, Then?
    
* you'd think maybe our government controls it, but that isn't true either. At most, the government can remove 2-3 Facebook posts or block websites But they can be bypassed easily And this does not amount to control over the internet worldwide
    
* Then, maybe you could think that companies like Google, Facebook and Youtube control it because they have the largest amount of data, but that isn't true either, because you can build a website of your own and these companies would not be able to interfere in it,
    

‚û°Ô∏è So the question is when you are building a website of your own, Who is providing you with the space to create the website on the internet? Is there a website that can tell you which website you can build and which website you cannot? In this blog, I'd like to tell you about the internet, Because the internet is an important tool in maintaining freedom and democracy, I think it's essential to understand how the internet works and what it is This is what I'd like to mention in this blog,

‚û°Ô∏è You need to go to [GoDaddy.com](http://GoDaddy.com) if you wish to buy a domain name for your website For example, I had to buy [manvithrockzz.com](http://manvithrockzz.com), so I went to [GoDaddy.com](http://GoDaddy.com) to buy it and now The question is, who gave GoDaddy the authority to sell domain names? Who is GoDaddy to sell domain names? There must be someone who gives assent to GoDaddy to sell domain names. And if there's no one, then GoDaddy has become the boss of the internet in a way. That is, it would be the one to sell domain names but not the only one.

‚û°Ô∏è But this isn't so, There is another authority above it The name of this authority is ICANN Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers- ICANN This is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles You could say that this is the top-level authority regarding the internet, It has the power to authorize websites like GoDaddy.

‚û°Ô∏è ICANN decides which domain names can actually exist, such as .com, .in, .info, or .gov, and it sells top-level domain names to companies through bidding.¬† These companies are called "registries," and they, in turn, sell domain names to individuals or businesses through companies like [GoDaddy.com](http://GoDaddy.com), called "registrars."

üî• Therefore, while companies like Google and Facebook do not control the internet, there is a higher authority, ICANN, that oversees the sale and distribution of domain names and responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation and thus plays a significant role in controlling INTERNET.
