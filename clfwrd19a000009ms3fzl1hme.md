Heyy! Are you ready to crack the SDE interview and yes computer networking is essential for software development.

Have you ever wondered? How does the internet work, How does Computer works, what are the computer Architectures- This is the sort of mindset you need to have if you wanna be a great developer of the era.

In this Blog, I will try to mention all the related questions starting from how the internet works and you will be learning all these.

I will be adding all the important questions to the table and a precise single solution be added.
