Java is one of the most successful🧨 and most dreaded technologies in the computer science world. Let's roast this powerful open-source programming language to find out why it shouldn't have many haters👀.

Java is often considered a **boilerplate-driven language**. –It was designed for writing verbose and object-oriented code🔥.

Java is known for running on billions of devices, particularly on Blu-ray players.  It model is like write once, run everywhere ( debug easily)

Java has inspired other languages like👉 Groovy, Closure, Scala, and Kotlin.

Java tried to compete with JavaScript using applets on the web, but they were not successful.

Setting up Java development requires installing the JDK, JRE, and JVM.

`--> Try relating the below images🥵.`

* Developers often start with a public static void main method and use System.out.println for "Hello World."
    

```java
// Java Program to demonstrate the
// syntax of the main() function

class GeeksforGeeks {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("I am a Geek");
	}
}

o/p : I am a Geek
```

Java code tends to have more boilerplate compared to languages like Python🐍.

Writing large, deeply nested class hierarchies is common in Java.

Java is a polarizing language😙, but it's widely used and gets things done in the software world.

Java is the most used language, and having decent knowledge is preferred in the tech industry.
